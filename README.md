We will focus on three independent problems. These are:

1. **Monaural source separation** Using [source contrastive estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04662) (submitted to SiPS 2017).
2. Removing a source (whose location is static) that is dynamic and loud.
3. Multiple moving sources (i.e., the channel changes with time) 
4. Standoff distance acoustic enhancement (dynamic gain adjustment in low SNR)

This project will be primarily an analysis of cost functions (in supervised and unsupervised settings) that can be used in order to denoise and isolate signals. The resulting algorithms of interest will be a mix of cost function resembling ICA and simulated beamforming methods.
